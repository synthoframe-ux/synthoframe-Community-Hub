Synthoframe - The AI Collaboration Catalyst
Welcome to the official Synthoframe public repository.

Synthoframe is a leading AI collaboration tool built for UX/UI designers, frontend developers, and product managers. We are committed to using AI to automatically generate interactive and responsive high-fidelity prototypes, helping product managers and designers to rapidly validate ideas and iterate. Simultaneously, we provide developers with high-quality, editable frontend code, thereby bridging the gap between design and development.   

This repository serves as Synthoframe's community hub, designed to be the best platform for you to engage with our team and other community members.

🚀 Our Core Value Proposition
AI-Powered Prototype Accelerator: With just a text description or sketch, Synthoframe can instantly generate fully interactive, cross-device responsive high-fidelity prototypes. This dramatically shortens the distance from idea to a testable prototype.   

Seamless Design-to-Dev Workflow: We don't just generate beautiful designs; we also provide high-quality, editable frontend code (e.g., in React, Vue). This allows developers to use the code directly, eliminating the hassle of manual slicing and repetitive coding, and truly enabling efficient collaboration.   

💡 How You Can Engage
Although Synthoframe is a closed-source commercial product with a private core codebase , we firmly believe in the power of community. This repository is built for you to ensure you can easily communicate and interact with us.
